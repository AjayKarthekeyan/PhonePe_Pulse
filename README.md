# Title : Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration
## A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly
### Problem Statement : The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
## Approach:
1. Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the
Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV
or JSON.
2. Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with
libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may
include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data
into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

4. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to
connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL
commands.

5. Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create
an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map
functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used
to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to
select different facts and figures to display.

6. Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the
MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

7. Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test
the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it
accessible to users.

This approach leverages the power of Python and its numerous libraries to extract,
transform, and analyze data, and to create a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing
the insights obtained from the data.

## File Information
The images folder have all the pics and videos for this project and all the images and videos I took from PhonePe website.
#
In Interactive Python Notebook -> data extraction,data cleaning,data filtering and all the data sorts of operation are done in .ipynb file. First execute the .ipynb file then movve on to .py file. For easy understanding of the project.
#
In Python file all the streamlit codes are written Sql queries are used to find insights from the phonepe pulse dataset.
